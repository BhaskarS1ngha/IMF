# ITERATIVE MEAN FILTER

This repository contains the python implementation of the algorithm described in the paper *[Erkan, Uğur & Thanh, Dang & Le Minh, Hieu & Enginoğlu, Serdar. (2019). An Iterative Mean Filter for Image Denoising. IEEE Access. 7. 167847 - 167859. 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953924. ](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953924)*

## Description
The file `iterative_mean_filter.py` contains the implementation of the algorithm described in the paper. The file `demo.ipynb` contains a demo of the algorithm on noisy images generated from a subset of the standard image dataset provided in the `test_images` folder. The file `helperFunctions.py` contains the function addImpulseNoise used for adding synthetic impulse noise to an image.The file `requirements.txt` contains the list of python dependencies.
